### Features

- **Multi-Method Scraping**: Automatically choose between simple HTTP, Scrapy, Selenium, or Playwright based on requirements
- **Anti-Bot Detection**: Advanced stealth techniques to bypass common anti-scraping measures
- **Concurrent Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple URLs simultaneously
- **Smart Caching**: In-memory caching with TTL to improve performance and reduce server load
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive retry logic with categorized error handling
- **Form Automation**: Full support for form filling and submission across different input types
- **Data Extraction**: Flexible, configuration-driven data extraction system
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics collection and reporting
- **Proxy Support**: Optional proxy configuration for enhanced anonymity
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request rate limiting to respect server resources

### Technical Details

- Built on FastMCP framework for MCP protocol compliance
- Asynchronous architecture for high performance
- Modular design for easy extension and customization
- Type hints throughout for better code quality
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Docker-ready configuration (planned for future release)

### Dependencies

- fastmcp>=0.2.0
- scrapy>=2.11.0
- selenium>=4.15.0
- playwright>=1.40.0
- undetected-chromedriver>=3.5.0
- And other supporting libraries (see requirements.txt)

### Known Issues

- Chrome/Chromium browser required for Selenium and stealth features
- Some anti-bot protections may still detect automation (continuously improving)
- Large concurrent requests may require memory optimization

### Future Plans

- Docker containerization
- Additional browser engine support
- Enhanced anti-detection techniques
- Machine learning-based content extraction
- Distributed scraping support
- GraphQL and API integration
- WebSocket support for real-time scraping
